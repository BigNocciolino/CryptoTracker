# CryptoTracker ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ 

⚠️ Given the latest issues with the API, I am rewriting the project in spite of the API written by [fawazahmed0](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api). At the moment the component is not working !!!

## Current branch

This is the developement branch for the new api implementation
