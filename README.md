# CryptoTracker

Component for tracking data generated by the API created by [fawazahmed0](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api). Which provides updated data every 24 hours, with a coverage of 150+ cryptocurrencies.

**Note:** For those who have the component already configured from the config file, it will no longer work. Now it can only be configured from UI. [See this section](#moving-from-the-config-file)

## Features

- UI setup
- 150+ more currencies
- Update every 12 hours

## Installation

This integration is distributed using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

After installing it go to `Configuration` => `Devices & Services` => `+ Add Integration` and search for `Cryptostate`.

**Note:** To add multiple sensors you need add multiple instaces of the sensor.

## Setup  

Now the component can be configured from the graphical interface, setting the value of `crypto` and the value of `base` (i.e. the value with which we want to convert crypto)

To get a full list of available currencies visit this [page](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies.json).

### My configuration  

Sience the api update itself every day i suggest to use the built in [Statistic graph](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/statistics-graph/) card.

**Example:**

## Moving from the config file

Moving from the config fil to the UI is really simple, first of all you need to look all the `-compare:` options in your sensor configuration in the yaml.

``` yaml
sensor:
- platform: cryptostate
  resources:
    # This will gi in the (Crypto ticker) - (Base ticker) section UI.
    - compare: doge-eur
    # This will go in the (Name) section of the UI
      name: dogecoin
```

This up here can be an example of configuration, to move this to the UI we need to take the `Crypto ticker`, the `Base ticker` and the `Name`.

- `Crypto ticker` => `doge`
- `Base ticker` => `eur`
- `Name` => `dogecoin`
