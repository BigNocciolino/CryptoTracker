# CryptoTracker

Component for tracking data generated by the API created by [fawazahmed0](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api). Which provides updated data every 24 hours, with a coverage of 150+ cryptocurrencies.

**Note:** For those who have the component already configured from the config file, it will no longer work. Now it can only be configured from UI

## Features

- UI setup
- 150+ more currencies
- Update every 12 hours

## Installation

The component is available in the hacs store, you only need to search it and after you can configure it from the `Devices & Services` page in the `Configuration` page.

## Setup 

Now the component can be configured from the graphical interface, setting the value of `crypto` and the value of `base` (i.e. the value with which we want to convert crypto)

### My configuration 

Sience the api update itself every day i suggest to use the built in `Statistic graph` card.
